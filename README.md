The world's most simple website builder.
<br>
Simple Builder offers 9 different ways to build your website in seconds. Make your website advanced, but build it simply.

## Products
Products are the free tools that you use to build your website with. There are 9 products to build your website and add additional features like generated policies and security preferences.

### Drag n' Drop builder
The Drag n' Drop builder on here is a flawless, simple editor on Simple Builder. Add blocks to your page, change the block's design (like dimensions, color, etc.) and finally add elements to this block. The elements that go into the block include paragraphs, headers, buttons, spacers, forms, raw HTML, and more.

Simple Builder supports as many platforms as we can, touch devices and desktop devices included. This means you can use touch devices to build your websites easily.

[Here](https://github.com/Parking-Master/Simple-Builder/raw/main/examples/dashboard-drag-n-drop.mov) is a preview of the Drag n' Drop builder if you would like to see it (logged in users can use this product).

### Virtual Machines
Simple Builder provides every user with a free Virtual Machine that runs in your browser. The specs of this machine are:

- __Operating system__: [Linux] Raspberry Pi Bullseye OS (Debian 11)
- __RAM__: 4GB
- __Storage__: 10kB

You can open this at any time on your [Dashboard](https://builder.serveo.net/dashboard) and spin up this VM instantly. When using this, you can run almost every Linux command and a pre-installed Visual Studio Code editor along with it. This all enables you to basically use a Linux machine to create your website directly from your browser.

[Here](https://github.com/Parking-Master/Simple-Builder/raw/main/examples/dashboard-virtual-machines.mov) is a preview of the Virtual Machine if you would like to see it (logged in users can use this product).

### MailKit Newsletters
MailKit is a free automated newsletter service. This product was originally designed by our old project, <a href="https://github.com/Parking-Master/Simple-Mailer">Simple Mailer</a>. MailKit was re-designed and brought to Simple Builder with even more features than before.

So, what can you do with MailKit? Instead of catching every email from every single user that signs up to your website, you can link a service ID to your created form on the Drag n' Drop builder, and link this service ID to a newsletter in MailKit on your [Dashboard](https://builder.serveo.net/dashboard). This enables you to quickly create a form and newsletter, and link the newsletter to that form so when users sign up to the newsletter on your website, Simple Builder will send all the emails you chose to all of those users who signed up.

[Here](https://github.com/Parking-Master/Simple-Builder/raw/main/examples/dashboard-mailkit-newsletters.mov) is a preview of the HTML editor if you would like to see it (logged in users can use this product).

### Node.js playground
With a free API provided by RunKit, we enable users to run any file on their website or Virtual Machine through this Node.js-powered terminal and playground directly in your browser.

[Here](https://github.com/Parking-Master/Simple-Builder/raw/main/examples/dashboard-node-js-in-the-cloud.mov) is a preview of the Node.js playground if you would like to see it (logged in users can use this product).

### Domain settings
Along with everything else we already mentioned, every user also gets up to 2 domains per account on Simple Builder. We have two options for domains.

The first option is free subdomains provided by our API, where you enter the subdomain you want, and choose the website to connect it to. Once you set up this domain, it will be fully active withing 24 hours with TLS encryption. In case you are wondering, the free subdomains look like `{domain}.bdr.uk.to`.

The second option is transferring your own domain. Setup is pretty simple for this process. Just enter the domain name you have purchased, choose the website you want to connect the domain to, and set up one `A` record in your domain's DNS settings. We will walk you through everything when you set it up.

[Here](https://github.com/Parking-Master/Simple-Builder/raw/main/examples/dashboard-domain-settings.mov) is a preview of the Domain settings if you would like to see it (logged in users can use this product).

### Security management
One of our greatest products on Simple Builder are the Security management settings. Your Simple Builder website will always have some security no matter what, because it is built into the entire server. But, the Security management product allows you to make these settings more strict, get recommendations for security, and preview the security of your website.

These security settings are powered by [Simple Secure](https://builder.serveo.net/blog/security), our community-trusted security API. Learn more about Simple Secure [here](https://builder.serveo.net/blog/security).
